# MAIN.md

STOP. This file is not the workflow entry point.

The authoritative entry point for this project is:
- [`instructions.md`](instructions.md)

All project behavior, routing, defaults, and references to other markdown files are defined in `instructions.md`.
Do not implement logic from `MAIN.md`. Do not add rules here. If something needs to change, change `instructions.md`.
