## How to use this file
1) Choose **one primary occasion** (a base).
2) Optionally add modifiers:
   - **0–1 setting modifier**
   - **0–1 service style modifier**
   - **0–1 menu shape modifier**
Keep modifiers minimal. If you need more than two, the base selection is probably wrong.

All entries use the same fields:
- optimize
- avoid
- assumptions
- options-directives
- recipe-directives
- common-modifiers
