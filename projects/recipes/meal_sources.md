# Recipe Sources & Research Guide (Recipes Only)

**Scope:** How we find and vet recipe sources for ingredients, ratios, techniques, timing, and gear.  
**Out of scope:** nutrition/macros/health claims.  
**Exception:** we still verify food safety and technique correctness (see §9).

---

## 1) Source Mix and Tiers (Use 5–7 per recipe)

### Hard requirements (always)
- Use **5–7 distinct sources** per recipe (distinct URLs and creators; cross-posts count once).
- Include real variety (see §10 for how to spot low-signal sources):
  - **2+ Tier 1 individual creators** (distinct people/handles; not the same person republished).
  - **1+ long-form blog/personal site** (text-first; not an aggregator).
  - **1+ video/social source** (YouTube preferred; Instagram/TikTok acceptable).
  - **1+ discussion / feedback-loop source** (forum thread OR substantial comment section with troubleshooting).
- **Regional anchor rule (when applicable):**
  - If the dish has clear regional/cultural provenance, include **at least 1 Regional Anchor** source (definition below).
- **Baseline recipe sites** are triangulation only; they do not define the dish.

### Counting and dedup rules
- Cross-posts (same content on IG + YouTube + blog) count as **one**.
- Multiple pages from the same author count as **one**, unless materially different; if counted separately, note why.
- “Content network” (same template/voice replicated across domains) counts as **one** and is usually excluded (see §10).

### Tier definitions

**Tier 1 — Core, Individual, Hands-On**
- Identifiable cook (home or pro) with concrete steps and measurable details, plus evidence of real execution and/or meaningful troubleshooting (see §10).
- Social/video from real cooks: YouTube/Instagram/TikTok where the creator demonstrably cooks the dish and (a) provides enough measurable detail or (b) passes follow-up checks (see §8).

**Tier 2 — Corroborating, Technique-Focused**
- Specialty forums and Q&A threads with multi-user agreement and dated replies.
- Chef/practitioner/test-kitchen pieces with deep method discussion (not listicles).

**Regional Anchor (required when the dish is region-linked)**  
A source that credibly ties the dish to its origin or diaspora practice, e.g.:
- A creator from the region/diaspora explicitly presenting the dish as lived practice,
- A region-specialist practitioner writeup,
- A community/regional cookbook,
- A bilingual or origin-language source demonstrating authentic usage and method.

**Baseline recipe sites (triangulation only; never the sole basis)**
- Method-driven editorial sites may be used to sanity-check **ratio bands, temps/times, terminology**.
- If used, mark them as **[secondary]** in research notes and do not let them define flavor profile/cultural framing.

---

## 2) Exclusion Policy (No Blogspam / Content-Farms)

**Hard rule:** do not use (and do not cite) low-signal sources that are scraped, mass-produced, templated, or otherwise untrustworthy.  
(These often include AI-generated pages, but the policy is broader than “AI.”)

### Immediate exclusion signals (any one is sufficient)
- The page is clearly a **content-farm** pattern (template intros, endless filler, weak or generic method).
- Contradictory ingredients vs steps, or missing measurable parameters (temps/times/ratios) with no clarifications.
- “Ultimate/best ever” roundup/listicle framing with shallow method content.
- Identical or near-identical recipe text appears across multiple domains (syndication/network).
- Unclear authorship (no real author identity, or fake bios) and no evidence of iterative cooking.

### If unsure, apply follow-up checks (see §10)
- Do at least 2 checks before allowing it into the shortlist.
- If it fails authenticity checks, exclude it and log it.

### Search hygiene
- Use negative filters when practical:
  - `-pinterest -buzzfeed -listicle -roundup`
  - plus additional negatives if needed (e.g., `-ai -chatgpt -generated`) to reduce sludge
- Avoid recipe aggregators by default.

---

## 3) Search Protocol (Technique-Forward, Variety-Enforced)

### Step 0: Identify provenance
- Determine whether the dish is strongly region-linked.
- Identify origin-language name(s) or common transliterations when applicable.

### Step 1: Build queries
Write **4–6 queries** that bias toward cooks who understand technique and can explain it.

Use modifiers that pull competent, technique-literate sources:
- Competence signals: `tested` `trial` `notes` `method` `why it works` `technique` `ratio` `by weight` `grams`
- Process signals: `step by step` `process photos` `texture cues` `temperature` `thermometer` `internal temp`
- Pro cues (use selectively): `chef` `restaurant` `culinary` `line cook` `pastry chef` `baker's percentage`

Optional domain targeting (use sparingly; do not over-filter):
- `site:youtube.com`
- `site:instagram.com`
- `site:reddit.com` (or other relevant forums)
- `site:wordpress.com site:blogspot.com`

**Multilingual requirement (when applicable)**
- Run **at least 1–2 queries** using the origin-language name/transliteration before finalizing the shortlist.

### Step 2: Build the candidate pool
- Pull **10–14** candidates across blogs, video/social, and forums.
- Bias toward candidates that look strong under §10, not just popular.

### Step 3: Shortlist
- Shortlist **5–7** sources that satisfy the mix in §1.
- If region-linked, ensure the **Regional Anchor** is included.
- Apply dedup rules; avoid “different mirrors of the same recipe.”

### Step 4: Comment-mining deep dive (required)
- Blogs / recipe pages with comments:
  - Review **at least 60 comments** (or all if fewer), prioritizing outcome reports, substitutions, and failures.
- YouTube:
  - Review **at least 150 comments** total when available:
    - First 100 “Top”
    - plus at least 50 from “Newest” (or an equivalent scroll/sample)
  - Capture creator replies and any pinned corrections.
- Forums:
  - Read the thread end-to-end if reasonable; otherwise read the top-level posts plus the most upvoted and most disputed replies.

Comment-mining output must produce:
- At least **3 recurring failure modes**, and
- At least **3 corrective adjustments or guardrails** (including “do not do X” constraints).

### Step 5: Viral recipe containment
- If the dish/technique is trending/viral:
  - Require **2+ independent Tier 1 creators** (not referencing each other).
  - Require **1 Regional Anchor or non-viral anchor** (cookbook/practitioner/older source).
  - Treat baseline recipe sites strictly as **[secondary]**.

### Step 6: Recordkeeping
- Record publish/update dates and access dates.
- Save an archive snapshot for fragile sources (especially IG/TikTok) when practical.

## 4) Extract These Data From Each Source

From each source, capture:
- **Yield & vessel:** pan/tin dimensions, pot capacity, batch size.
- **Time/temperature:** preheats, simmer/bake ranges, internal targets when applicable.
- **Core ratios:** salt per lb (or %), hydration %, fat %, spice ratios, flour:liquid, etc.
- **Technique & sequence:** order of ops, rests/ferments/proofs, cut/grind sizes, emulsification steps.
- **Cues:** texture/visual/audio checkpoints (nappe, windowpane, bead size, sizzle level).
- **Tools & materials:** required/optional gear (Dutch oven size, processor vs mortar, sieve mesh).
- **Distinctives:** choices to offer as variations.
- **Comment-mined findings:** failure modes + corrections/guardrails.

---

## 5) Reconcile & Decide (No Inference)

- Identify the overlapping **ratio band** (e.g., 1.6–2.2% salt; 65–70% hydration).
- Choose a grounded middle; surface authentic alternatives as **variations**.
- Convert to U.S. customary units; include parenthetical metric when the source is metric.

### No inference rule
- Do not “fill in” missing measurable details (salt %, temps, timings, liquid amounts) from intuition.
- A measurable parameter may only be adopted if:
  - It appears in the primary source, OR
  - It is supported by **at least 2 independent sources**, OR
  - It is clarified by creator replies/pinned comments and corroborated by at least one other independent source.
- If it cannot be validated, it remains an **open question** or becomes an optional variation with clear uncertainty.

### If deviating from a popular method
- Include a one-line rationale grounded in comment-mined failures or multi-source disagreement.

---

## 6) Citation / Attribution (Recipe Footer)

List **2–4** top sources compactly:
- **Author or Site** — *Title* (Year/Date). For videos/social, add timestamps if a specific segment informed the method.
- Baseline recipe sites should not dominate top citations; keep them **[secondary]** unless they materially shaped a narrow sanity-check.

## 8) Video & Social (Use + Follow-Up Checks)

Video and social are encouraged, but must be validated before they drive ratios/times/temps.

### How they can be used
- If a video/post provides full measurements and clear technique, it can be a Tier 1 driver.
- If it is missing key measurable details, it can still inform technique cues and sequencing, but cannot set final ratios/times/temps unless validated per §5.

### Required follow-up checks (especially for IG/TikTok)
- Apply the follow-up validation steps in §10 (creator identity, measurable details, corrections, duplication/network).
- Check caption/description, pinned comments, and creator replies for missing quantities.
- Cross-check adopted measurable claims against at least one other independent source.
- Capture timestamps for technique cues; record pinned corrections/updates.

---

## 9) Safety and Correctness Checks

- **Food safety:** cross-check hazards tied to method (beans/lectins, canning, sous-vide, eggs, cooling/holding).
- **Technique correctness:** flag and fix steps that are likely wrong unless strong evidence supports them.
- When adjusting for safety/correctness, keep a brief note in research and a succinct explanation in the recipe.

---

## 10) Authenticity Signals and Follow-Up Checks (Expanded)

Use this section as the single source of truth for judging authenticity and filtering blogspam.

### 10.1 Positive authenticity signals (strong indicators)
- **Technique specificity:** weights/ratios, temps, pan sizes, cut sizes, timing ranges, and sensory cues.
- **Evidence of real execution:** process checkpoints (not just the final plate), visible intermediate states, acknowledged edge cases.
- **Iterative competence:** explicit troubleshooting, what to do if it breaks, adjustments by environment (pan, altitude, humidity, burner strength).
- **Feedback loop:** meaningful comments/Q&A and creator replies; pinned corrections; updates over time.
- **Creator legitimacy:** consistent identity and body of work; not a faceless network brand.
- **Independence:** the method and prose feel unique, not re-skinned from a shared template.

### 10.2 Red flags (blogspam / content-farm indicators)
- Generic or templated language; long filler intros; “SEO voice.”
- Missing measurable parameters with no clarifications; contradictions between ingredients and steps.
- Copy-like structure repeated across many recipes on the same site; suspiciously broad coverage without depth.
- Duplicate text detected across domains; syndication networks; “recipe plugin sameness.”
- Social content that is purely aesthetic: fast cuts, no method, no quantities, no clarifying replies.

### 10.3 Follow-up checks (required when a source is borderline)
When any red flag appears, do **at least 2** of the following before including it:
1) **Identity check:** About page/creator profile; consistency across posts; non-syndicated presence.
2) **Method check:** are key measurable parameters present (or clarified in comments/replies)?
3) **Evidence check:** does the source show intermediate states and technique moments?
4) **Feedback-loop check:** do comments reveal real outcomes and does the creator respond?
5) **Duplication/network check:** spot-check a unique sentence or step; if it appears elsewhere, exclude.

### 10.4 Lightweight scoring (optional but useful)
Score each candidate quickly (0–2 each; 10 max):
- Technique specificity
- Evidence of execution
- Troubleshooting depth
- Feedback loop quality
- Independence (non-network)

Guidance:
- **8–10:** strong Tier 1/Tier 2 candidate
- **5–7:** borderline; include only if it fills a required slot and passes follow-up checks
- **0–4:** exclude
