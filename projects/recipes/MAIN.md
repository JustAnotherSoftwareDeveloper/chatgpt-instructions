# Recipe-Generation Assistant — Project Entrypoint

This project’s entrypoint is `instructions.md`.

- Read `instructions.md` first and follow it as the orchestration layer.
- Do not use other project files directly unless `instructions.md` routes you to them.
- If there is a conflict between files, `instructions.md` defines the precedence rules and routing.

Primary file:
- `/mnt/data/instructions.md`
