## Detailed Instructions
[Directions must be free-form but structured as (A) Read Once (Plan) and (B) Cook Now (Steps).
Use nested bullets. Avoid big paragraphs; keep to bullets and short sentences.
Prefer cues first, clock second.
Do NOT repeat template rules or meta-instructions in the final recipe output.]

A) Read Once (Plan) - 8 to 12 bullets total
- What you are making: [1 sentence; what the final dish is and how it should eat]
- Endpoint in plain terms: [1 sentence; final texture/consistency/doneness]
- Key checkpoints (3 to 6 bullets): [the "until..." cues that matter most]
- Workflow overview (3 to 6 bullets): [order of operations; what can overlap]
  - Include at least one "While X cooks, do Y" workflow note.
- Make-ahead stop(s): [where you can stop; how to cool/store; what changes after chilling]
- Reheat plan: [how to reheat and the cue it is ready; how to restore texture]
- Seasoning plan: [when salt enters; what acid/herbs finish; taste-adjust order at end]
- Biggest risks (1 to 3 bullets): [most likely failure points; do not repeat Error-proofing]

Formatting and nesting rules (required)
- Main flow is numbered steps (1), 2), 3) ...).
- Each numbered step must include nesting:
  - At least 1 bullet with sub-bullets.
  - Across the whole recipe, include at least 2 "branch" sub-bullets (If X -> do Y -> cue its fixed).
- Bold actual substance and settings the cook scans for (examples; not exhaustive):
  - Bold cooking verbs and actions such as: **Bake**, **Roast**, **Simmer**, **Saute**, **Boil**, **Sear**, **Brown**, **Deglaze**, **Whisk**, **Fold**, **Reduce**, **Rest**, **Blend**, **Chill**, **Freeze**.
  - Bold heat and temperature phrases: **medium heat**, **medium-high heat**, **low heat**, **425 deg F**.
  - Optionally bold one key endpoint phrase per step (keep it to one).
  - Do not bold whole sentences; bold phrases only.
- Use italics for optional/conditional notes that can be skipped.
- Use inline code only for exact literals/settings when needed: `425 deg F`, `medium-high`, `1/2-in`.

Heat-step minimum detail (required whenever heat is involved)
- Include: heat level or oven temp, a time range, and at least one sensory cue.
- Prefer: "X to Y minutes, until [cue]" rather than exact minutes.
- When cook time depends on size, specify thickness/size in the same step.

B) Cook Now (Steps)
1) [Phase title: e.g., "Stage and prep", "Build the base", "Simmer/roast", "Finish"]
   - [Main bullet: what to do]
     - [Sub-bullets: prep details affecting cook time (size/thickness), order of additions]
     - [Sub-bullets: **Heat**/**Oven** + time range + cue; include the "until..." endpoint]
     - *[While this runs: parallel task]*
     - **Checkpoint:** You are ready to proceed when [cue].
     - *If [symptom], then [primary fix]; cue its fixed.*

2) [Next phase title]
   - [Main bullet]
     - [Sub-bullets: **Heat**/**Oven** + time range + cue]
     - [Sub-bullets: reduction/consistency test if relevant (what it should look like)]
     - **Checkpoint:** You are ready to proceed when [cue].
     - *If [symptom], then [primary fix]; cue its fixed.*

3) [Next phase title]
   - [Main bullet]
     - [Sub-bullets: **Heat**/**Oven** + time range + cue; doneness cue for any protein]
     - **Checkpoint:** You are ready to proceed when [cue].

4) Finish and taste-adjust (required final step)
   - [Main bullet: combine/rest as needed]
     - [Sub-bullets: final texture cue; whether to stop early if reheating later]
     - Taste-adjust loop (required): acid -> salt -> heat -> herbs.
     - **Checkpoint:** Final dish is [key endpoint cue].

### Optional: Instruction Table
[Use when timing/parallel tasks benefit from a grid. Keep cues concrete.]

| Step | Task | Heat/Temp | Time Range | Sensory Cues | Tools/Notes |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | [task] | [heat/temp] | [range] | [cue] | [notes] |
| 2 | [task] | [heat/temp] | [range] | [cue] | [notes] |

## Make-Ahead Map
[Call out what can be done 1–3 days ahead; what freezes; thaw + reheat cues.]
- Fridge plan:
  - Stop after Step [#]: [how to cool/store; container guidance]
  - Holds: [X days]
  - Reheat: [method] until [cue]; then [texture reset + re-season note]
- Freezer plan:
  - Best freeze point: Step [#] or component [name]
  - Portioning: [portion size and container guidance]
  - Freeze: [Y months]
  - Thaw: [method]
  - Reheat: [method] until [cue]; then [texture reset + re-season note]

## Error-proofing (required; 2 to 4 bullets total)
- [Symptom] -> [Likely cause] -> [Primary fix] -> [Recovery cue]
- [Symptom] -> [Likely cause] -> [Primary fix] -> [Recovery cue]

## Troubleshooting (Optional Table)
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|---|---|---|
| [Too salty] | [Over-salted or reduced too far] | [Add unsalted starch; splash of water/stock; acid to balance] |
| [Too watery] | [Crowded pan / insufficient reduction] | [Reduce uncovered; finish hotter; small slurry if appropriate] |
| [Split emulsion] | [Too hot / fat added too fast] | [Whisk in tsp warm water off heat; re-emulsify slowly] |

## Geometry notes (include when relevant)
- Pan/pot size used:
- Target thickness / layer depth:

- Serving ideas: [brief list of sides, sauces, garnishes]
- Variations: [authentic alternatives; optional additions; spice toggles]
- Dietary toggles (only if requested): [low-sodium / high-protein / low-FODMAP / gluten-free / dairy-free] with concrete swaps that preserve technique
- Sodium (optional but recommended): [top 3 sodium drivers + concrete levers]
