# Beans and Greens "Sausage" Pasta (Sausage-Spiced Ground Pork)

## Title & Overview
This is a weeknight Italian-ish pasta built around the classic combo of sausage, white beans, and greens, tuned to feel lighter by leaning on beans and greens for volume. [1]
Instead of buying sausage, you season ground pork with a fennel-forward blend so you control salt and heat while keeping the familiar Italian-sausage profile. [3]
The sauce turns lightly creamy without cream by mashing some beans, then finishing the pasta in the skillet with starchy pasta water plus a modest amount of grated cheese. [2]

## Detailed Instructions
A) Read Once (Plan)
- What you are making: sausage-spiced ground pork, cannellini beans, and greens tossed with short pasta in a lightly creamy, glossy pan sauce. [1]
- Endpoint in plain terms: pasta is coated (not soupy), beans are partially mashed into the sauce, greens are tender, and the pork is browned and juicy.
- Key checkpoints:
  - Fennel is fragrant, not scorched, after toasting.
  - Pork is browned with no pink and hits 160 deg F. [4]
  - Sauce looks lightly creamy after mashing some beans and reducing briefly.
  - Pasta finishes in the skillet and looks glossy after tossing with pasta water + cheese. [2]
- Workflow overview:
  - Season pork (and optionally rest) while you start pasta water.
  - Brown pork first, then build the sauce in the same skillet.
  - Cook pasta while the sauce base simmers; finish pasta in the skillet at the end.
  - While pasta water heats, prep onion/garlic/greens and drain beans.
- Make-ahead stop(s):
  - Stop after browning the pork and building the bean-greens sauce (before adding pasta); cool and refrigerate.
- Reheat plan:
  - Reheat sauce gently until steaming, then toss with freshly cooked pasta and a splash of pasta water.
  - For leftovers already mixed with pasta, reheat covered and stir; heat to 165 deg F. [5]
- Biggest risks:
  - Scorching fennel or garlic (turns bitter).
  - Sauce tightening too much when you add pasta (fix with pasta water).
  - Overcooking pasta during the final toss (finish just to al dente).

B) Cook Now (Steps)
1) Season the pork ("sausage" blend)
   - Toast and crush fennel:
     - Put fennel seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat for 60 to 90 seconds until fragrant (do not scorch).
     - Crush lightly (mortar/pestle, or a bag + rolling pin).
   - Mix the pork:
     - Combine pork, crushed fennel, marjoram, pepper, salt, and 1 tsp grated garlic; add optional red pepper flakes/cayenne/sugar.
     - Mix just until evenly combined (do not knead). [3]
   - Rest 10 minutes (or cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours). [3]
   - Checkpoint: seasoning looks evenly distributed with no dense spice clumps.

2) Start the pasta water
   - Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
     - Salt the water lightly (you will add salty elements later via pork seasoning and cheese).
     - While this comes to a boil, dice the onion, slice/mince the garlic, chop the greens, and drain/rinse the beans.
   - Checkpoint: water is at a steady rolling boil.

3) Brown the sausage-spiced pork
   - In a large high-sided skillet, heat avocado oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers.
   - Add pork in large chunks and let it sit 2 to 3 minutes to brown.
     - Break up and continue cooking 5 to 7 minutes, until no pink remains and you have browned edges.
     - Ground pork should reach 160 deg F. [4]
   - Transfer pork to a bowl with a slotted spoon.
   - Spoon off excess rendered fat, leaving about 1 tbsp in the pan.
   - Checkpoint: you have browned pork bits in the pan and the pork is fully cooked.

4) Build the bean base and wilt the greens
   - Add onion to the skillet and saute over medium heat 3 to 4 minutes, until softened.
   - Add garlic and cook 30 to 60 seconds, until fragrant (do not brown).
   - Stir in tomato paste and cook 60 to 90 seconds, until it darkens slightly and looks glossy.
   - Optional: add wine and simmer 30 to 60 seconds to reduce.
   - Add beans and 3/4 cup broth (or water); scrape up browned bits.
     - Mash about 1/2 cup of beans against the side of the pan to create a lightly creamy base. [2]
   - Add greens:
     - Escarole: add in handfuls and simmer 1 to 2 minutes, stirring, until wilted.
     - Kale: add with an extra splash of broth/water, cover and simmer 2 to 4 minutes, until tender, then uncover and stir.
   - Return pork (and any juices) to the skillet and simmer 1 to 2 minutes.
   - Checkpoint: sauce looks lightly creamy from mashed beans, greens are tender, and pork is warmed through.

5) Cook pasta and finish in the skillet
   - Cook pasta until 1 minute shy of al dente.
   - Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta water, then drain.
   - Add pasta to the skillet with 1/2 cup pasta water and 1/3 cup grated cheese.
     - Toss 60 to 90 seconds, until the sauce turns glossy and clings to the pasta (add more pasta water a few tablespoons at a time if needed). [2]
   - Taste and adjust:
     - Add black pepper as needed.
     - Add salt only if needed, in small pinches.
     - Optional: add 1 to 2 tsp lemon juice if it feels heavy.
   - Checkpoint: final dish is glossy, not watery, and the pasta is al dente.

6) Serve
   - Serve with remaining cheese at the table (keeps total dairy and sodium easier to control).

- Make-Ahead Map:
  - Fridge plan:
    - Stop after Step 4: cool the pork-beans-greens sauce in a shallow container.
    - Holds: 3 to 4 days. [5]
    - Reheat: simmer gently until steaming, then toss with freshly cooked pasta + a splash of pasta water; finish with cheese.
  - Freezer plan:
    - Best freeze point: Step 4 (freeze the sauce only; pasta texture is best fresh).
    - Portioning: freeze flat in zip bags or in 2-cup containers for faster thawing.
    - Thaw: overnight in the fridge, or use a gentle covered microwave thaw.
    - Reheat: heat until steaming; for mixed leftovers, reheat to 165 deg F. [5]

- Error-proofing
  - Fennel tastes bitter -> scorched seeds -> toast shorter on medium heat -> fixed when it smells sweet/anise-y.
  - Sauce is dry/tight -> not enough pasta water or over-reduced -> add pasta water 2 tbsp at a time and toss -> fixed when glossy and loose enough to coat.
  - Greens are stringy/tough -> undercooked kale -> cover and steam 2 to 4 more minutes -> fixed when tender but still bright.

- Geometry notes
  - Pan/pot size used: large high-sided skillet (12 in recommended) + large pasta pot.
  - Target thickness / layer depth: pork in a single layer for first browning; stir only after it releases.
  - Crowding rule: if the pork steams instead of browns, brown in two batches.

## Special Notes & Variations
- Storage & Reheat: Refrigerate leftovers 3 to 4 days. Reheat leftovers to 165 deg F; for microwave reheating, cover and rotate/stir for more even heating. [5]
- Serving ideas:
  - Side salad with a simple vinaigrette (brightness).
  - Add extra warmed beans if you want more fiber without increasing pasta.
- Dietary toggles:
  - Low-sodium: reduce pork salt to 3/4 tsp (about 4 g); use water or no-salt-added broth; keep cheese to a lighter finish. [3]
  - High-protein: increase pork to 1 1/4 lb; keep pasta at 12 oz.
  - Low-FODMAP-ish: replace garlic with garlic-infused oil; replace onion with scallion green tops; choose the greens you tolerate best.
  - Gluten-free: use GF short pasta; keep the bean-mash step for sauce body.
  - Dairy-free: skip cheese; rely on mashed beans + pasta water for body; finish with lemon and extra black pepper.
