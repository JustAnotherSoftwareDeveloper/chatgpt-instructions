## Ingredients
[List in use order. Use U.S. units; include metric in parentheses only if taken from a source. For small or precision-critical items, provide grams in parentheses. Mark advance-prep items with [pre-prep]. Specify drained/rinsed where relevant (canned beans, canned fish). Specify salted vs unsalted where relevant (broth/stock, butter).]

## Detailed Instructions
[Directions must be free-form but structured as (A) Read Once (Plan) and (B) Cook Now (Steps). Use nested bullets. Avoid big paragraphs; keep to bullets and short sentences. Prefer cues first, clock second.]

A) Read Once (Plan) - 8 to 12 bullets total
- What you are making: [1 sentence; what the final dish is and how it should eat]
- Endpoint in plain terms: [1 sentence; the final texture/consistency/doneness]
- Key checkpoints (3 to 6 bullets): [the "until..." cues that matter most]
- Workflow overview (3 to 6 bullets): [what happens in what order; what can overlap]
  - Include at least one "While X cooks, do Y" workflow note.
- Make-ahead stop(s): [where you can stop; how to cool/store; what changes after chilling]
- Reheat plan: [how to reheat and the cue it is ready; how to restore texture]
- Seasoning plan: [when salt enters; what acid/herbs finish; taste-adjust order at end]
- Biggest risks (1 to 3 bullets): [most likely failure points in this specific recipe]

Formatting and nesting rules (required)
- Main flow is numbered steps (1), 2), 3) ...).
- Each numbered step must include nesting:
  - At least 1 bullet with sub-bullets.
  - Across the whole recipe, include at least 2 "branch" sub-bullets (If X -> do Y -> cue its fixed).
- Bold actual substance and settings, not just endpoints:
  - Bold cooking verbs and settings the cook scans for: **Bake**, **Roast**, **Simmer**, **Saute**, **Boil**, **Rest**, **Blend**, **Chill**, **Freeze**.
  - Bold heat and temperature phrases: **medium heat**, **medium-high heat**, **low heat**, **425 deg F**.
  - Optionally bold one key endpoint phrase per step (keep it to one).
  - Do not bold whole sentences; bold phrases only.
- Use italics for optional/conditional notes that can be skipped.
- Use inline code only for exact literals/settings when needed: `425 deg F`, `medium-high`, `1/2-in`.

Heat-step minimum detail (required whenever heat is involved)
- Include: heat level or oven temp, a time range, and at least one sensory cue.
- Prefer the pattern: "X to Y minutes, until [cue]" rather than exact minutes.
- When cook time depends on size, specify thickness/size in the same step.

B) Cook Now (Steps)
1) [Phase title: e.g., "Stage and prep", "Build the base", "Simmer/roast", "Finish"]
   - [Main bullet: what to do]
     - [Sub-bullets: prep details that affect cook time (size/thickness), order of additions]
     - [Sub-bullets: **Heat**/**Oven** + time range + cue; include the "until..." endpoint]
     - *[While this runs: parallel task]*
     - **Checkpoint:** You are ready to proceed when [cue].
     - *If [symptom], then [primary fix]; cue its fixed.*

2) [Next phase title]
   - [Main bullet]
     - [Sub-bullets: **Heat**/**Oven** + time range + cue]
     - [Sub-bullets: reduction/consistency test if relevant (what it should look like)]
     - **Checkpoint:** You are ready to proceed when [cue].
     - *If [symptom], then [primary fix]; cue its fixed.*

3) [Next phase title]
   - [Main bullet]
     - [Sub-bullets: **Heat**/**Oven** + time range + cue; doneness cue for any protein]
     - **Checkpoint:** You are ready to proceed when [cue].

4) Finish and taste-adjust (required final step)
   - [Main bullet: combine/rest as needed]
     - [Sub-bullets: final texture cue and whether to stop cooking a little early for reheating]
     - Taste-adjust loop (required): acid -> salt -> heat -> herbs.
     - **Checkpoint:** Final dish is [key endpoint cue].

- Make-Ahead Map: [Call out what can be done 1-3 days ahead; what freezes; thaw + reheat cues.]
  - Fridge plan:
    - Stop after Step [#]: [how to cool/store; container guidance]
    - Holds: [X days]
    - Reheat: [method] until [cue]; then [texture reset + re-season note]
  - Freezer plan:
    - Best freeze point: Step [#] or component [name]
    - Portioning: [portion size and container guidance]
    - Freeze: [Y months]
    - Thaw: [method]
    - Reheat: [method] until [cue]; then [texture reset + re-season note]

- Error-proofing (required; 2 to 4 bullets total)
  - [Symptom] -> [Likely cause] -> [Primary fix] -> [Recovery cue]
  - [Symptom] -> [Likely cause] -> [Primary fix] -> [Recovery cue]

- Geometry notes (include when relevant)
  - Pan/pot size used: ...
  - Target thickness / layer depth: ...
  - Crowding rule: ...

## Nutrition Snapshot (per serving)
[Follow nutrition_calculation_method.md.

Rules:
- Never invent numbers.
- Include a numeric value for a metric only if it is eligible under nutrition_calculation_method.md (two independent calculators agree within 10 percent for that metric).
- If a required metric is not eligible, write "N/A" for that line (do not guess).
- If any numbers are shown, include one "Nutrition assumptions" line listing 1 to 3 highest-impact normalization assumptions (per nutrition_calculation_method.md).
- If most metrics are N/A, describe nutrition qualitatively (no numeric claims).
- If 4+ of the 7 required metrics are N/A, output only qualitative notes (no numbers) and remove the numeric list.]

- Calories: [x or N/A]
- Protein: [x g or N/A]
- Fiber: [x g or N/A]
- Fat: [x g] (sat [x g]) [or N/A]
- Added sugar: [x g or N/A]
- Potassium: [x mg or N/A]
- Sodium: [x mg or N/A]
- Nutrition assumptions: [only if any numbers are shown; 1 to 3 items max]
- If N/A: Reliable estimate not available because: [missing field OR >10% spread OR ambiguous ingredient mapping]

## Special Notes & Variations
- Storage & Reheat: [fridge/freezer durations and reheating guidance with temps; cite safety facts with a footnote when used.]
- Serving ideas: [brief list of sides, sauces, garnishes.]
- Sodium: [list top 3 sodium drivers + 2-4 concrete levers, even if nutrition is N/A.]
- Dietary toggles: [low-sodium / high-protein / low-FODMAP / gluten-free / dairy-free] with concrete swaps that preserve technique.
