# [Theme] Options List

## Title & Goal
[Write 2-3 sentences defining scope and constraints. Mention dietary needs, make-ahead preferences, appliances, and what "healthy" means here (qualitatively). State that options are sourced broadly with authenticity priority.]

Constraints snapshot:
- Musts:
- Avoid:
- Time budget (weeknight max):
- Appliances / gear:
- Make-ahead target (fridge vs freezer):
- Notes / assumptions:

## How This Was Researched
[1 short paragraph: cross-checked 3 to 5 authentic, diverse sources (mixed mediums: independent blogs, YouTube, forums, Instagram/TikTok only when replicable or validated) and avoided blogspam/aggregators. Note any key disagreements in temps, times, or ratios.]
Source mix: [e.g., 2 blogs, 1 YouTube, 1 forum, 1 authoritative safety ref]. Excluded: [count] low-signal sources.
Note: the list as a whole is supported by 3 to 5 sources; multiple options may cite the same sources.

Non-negotiables:
- Do NOT embed raw URLs in the Shortlist or Runner-Ups. Use footnote markers like [1] only.
- Put URLs only in the Sources section (plain URLs; one URL per line; strip tracking parameters when practical).
- Never invent links. If external browsing is not available, write: "No external browsing performed; sources omitted." Then omit footnotes and the Sources section entirely.
- If sources are omitted, do not include any [n] markers anywhere.

## Shortlist (Top 5 to 8)
Rules:
- Keep each option **5 lines max** (target 5; never exceed 6). Short and scannable; no full ingredient lists or step-by-step instructions.
- Avoid quantities in Shortlist unless essential for decision-making (e.g., "~1 lb ground pork").
- Place numeric footnotes [n] immediately after sentences that rely on external facts (temps, times, yields, safety windows, notable technique claims). Use timecodes for video claims when relevant, e.g., [1 @3:10].
- If any guardrail conflicts with a user-stated constraint, the user constraint wins.
- Distinctness guardrail (conditional):
  - Default (broad prompts): cover **at least 3 distinct formats** across the shortlist; no more than **2** options in the same format; no more than **2** options sharing the same primary protein.
  - If the Title & Goal explicitly narrows the scope (e.g., "all sheet-pan," "all pasta," "all bowls"):
    - Treat the requested scope as the fixed format constraint.
    - Instead, enforce diversity across **other axes**:
      - Primary protein/center-of-plate (no more than 2 per protein unless requested)
      - Sauce/base style (tomato vs cream-y vs herb/oil vs broth vs yogurt/tahini)
      - Cooking method within the format (roast vs broil finish vs stovetop + oven; sear-first vs roast-only)
      - Flavor profile (bright/tangy vs smoky vs herby vs spicy vs creamy)
      - Make-ahead strategy (freeze-a-component vs fridge-only vs day-2 improves)
- Source mapping: each Shortlist item should cite **one primary source** [n]. Multiple options may share sources when needed, but prefer diversity across the shortlist.

Per-option template (5 lines max; target 5):
- **[Option Name]** [tags: tag1, tag2, tag3, ...; format: bowl|skillet|sheet-pan|soup|pasta|salad; active: ~X min (est); effort: low|med|high]
  Flavor profile: richness [light|med|rich]; acidity [low|med|high]; heat [none|low|med|high]; notes: [2-4 descriptors]; texture: [1-2 descriptors]
  Make-ahead: [what to prep + storage target]. Reheat: [method + doneness cue]
  Watch: [1 common failure mode / guardrail]. Why it fits: [tie to goal]
  Source [Blog|YT|IG|Forum|Authoritative]. [n]

Tag guidance:
- Use **3 to 5 tags** max.
- Prefer a mix of: constraint tags (weeknight, pantry, freezer), macro-ish qualitative tags (veg-forward, bean-forward, high-protein), and flavor tags (bright, smoky, herby, spicy, savory-umami).

## Runner-Ups (5 to 10)
[One-liners only. Each must include a hook plus either (a) key technique, (b) main protein/bean, or (c) why it got bumped (time, ingredients, complexity). Add a footnote only if you actually used a source for that runner-up.]
- [Idea + hook + (technique/protein OR why bumped).]
- [Idea + hook + (technique/protein OR why bumped).]
- [Idea + hook + (technique/protein OR why bumped).]

## Pick First / If You Want...
[List 4 to 7 chooser rules routing the user to specific options (1-2 options per rule).]
- Fastest weeknight (lowest active time):
- Freezer-friendliest components (not whole dish):
- Best for leftovers (improves on day 2):
- Boldest flavor while staying lower-sodium-friendly:
- Minimal cleanup (one-pan / one-pot):
- Most veg-forward without feeling "diet food":
- Most pantry-staple friendly:

## Optional: Micro Grocery Highlights
[List 5 to 10 common items that cover most options (no quantities).]
- [Item] - covers [X options]
- [Item] - covers [X options]
- [Item] - covers [X options]

## Next Steps
- Tell me which option to expand into a full recipe.
- Or pick 2-3 options and ask for a combined grocery list that consolidates overlap.
- If you have constraints (budget, sodium sensitivity, dairy limits, dislikes), tell me and I will re-rank the shortlist.

## Sources
[Add numbered URLs matching any in-text footnotes. Plain URLs only (no embedded hyperlink text). Use transparent tags: type, region/cuisine (if relevant), and why. Include authoritative refs for safety claims.]

2. https://... - Regional Blog Name [type: blog; region: ...; why: technique + ratios]
3. https://... - Forum Thread [type: forum; region: ...; why: failure modes + corrections]
